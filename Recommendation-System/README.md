# Building a Recommendation System with MongoDB as a Vector Database and Hugging Face Embeddings

In this repository, I demonstrated how to build a simple recommendation system using MongoDB as a vector database and Hugging Face's models to generate vector embeddings. This system can be expanded by integrating it with a web interface, adding more sophisticated document preprocessing techniques, or experimenting with different similarity metrics and models.

MongoDBâ€™s flexibility makes it a great starting point for storing and retrieving document vectors, while Hugging Face provides powerful pre-trained models that simplify the NLP tasks.

# Overview of the System

The recommendation system can be divided into two main phases:

- Document Embedding and Storage: The vector embeddings for each text document is generated using a pre-trained NLP model from Hugging Face. These vectors are then stored in MongoDB.
- Query Embedding and Search: When a user submits a query, a vector embedding for the query is generated using the same NLP model. This query vector is then used to search the MongoDB database for the most similar document vectors.

# Prerequisites

- `python` 3.10 or higher
- `MongoDB Atlas` instance
- Hugging Face `transformers` and `sentence-transformers` library for `embedding` generation
- `pymongo` library for interacting with MongoDB

## Packages Installation

`pip install pymongo transformers sentence-transformers`

# Mongo DB Connection

Establish a MongoDB Database connection using `pymongo`
